    community to media outlets, government officials, interfaith leaders,

    practices of the vast majority of the world’s Muslims.  Ms. Najeeb serves on
    many committees and community boards as well as having been an adjunct
    professor at Cardinal Stritch University in Milwaukee, having taught the

    Resource Center on the south side of Milwaukee.

    Legislator with a prayer.

    the International Institute of Wisconsin’s World Citizen Award, The
