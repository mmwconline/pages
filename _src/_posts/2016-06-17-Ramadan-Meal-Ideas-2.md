We're back for another installment of "What To Make For Dinner." Last 
episode we treated you to the taste of India with some succulent lamb 
chops. This episode we will be making a classic Iraqi treat called 
"Jouz al-hind," also known as Coconut discs or how I've always known 
them, coconut macaroons (my caucasian heritage is showing). This recipe 
has been adapted from The IRAQI Cookbook by Lamees Ibrahim to fit our 
needs.

## Coconut Discs (Jouz al-Hind)
*Makes 25-35 treats*
*Prep time: 15 minutes - Baking Time: 10 minutes*

#### Ingredients
* 8 oz / 3 cups shredded coconut
* 3 eggs
* 6 oz / ¾ cup sugar
* a few drops of vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* Confectioner's sugar (optional)

Mix the eggs and sugar and beat with a fork. Add the vanilla extract. 
Stir in the lemon juice. Add the shredded coconut and mix well.

Add the baking powder and kneed the mixture until mixture becomes smooth 
and doughlike.

Form the dough into small balls (the size of walnuts) and place them on 
a greased baking tray. Make sure to leave about ½ - 1 inch between each.

Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F / 180°C for about 10 minutes or until 
slightly browned on top.

Decorate with a little confectioner's sugar.

Note: You can cool the dough in the fridge for half an hour before 
making the little balls. This will help to keep their shape during baking.

#### Variation
As I mentioned earlier, I've more often seen them called macaroons and 
were a staple of winter holidays in my home. Besides the traditional way 
described above, I've also done these with a little chocolate on the 
bottom or drizzled on top after baking. To do this, either slowly melt 
some semi-sweet chocolate in a double boiler or, if you don't have one, 
put about 1 inch of water in a pot and bring it to a gentle boil, 
placing a bowl on top so that the sides rest on the edges and the bottom 
does not touch the water. Place the chocolate in the bowl and stir 
constantly until melted. Dip the baked (and cooled) cookies in the 
chocolate and place on a cookie sheet covered in parchment paper and let 
dry/cool.

Stay tuned for more recipes as the month continues. This cookbook and 
others like it are available from our bookstore at the IRC. We return 
you now to your regularly scheduled library blog.
