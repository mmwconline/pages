With Ramadan about a month away, we thought now would be the perfect time to announce the arrival of a familiar simian friend to our center. Just released a few days ago, It's Ramadan, Curious George makes its debut appearance here at the IRC. Not only is it available to borrow from our library, we also have a stock of them for immediate sale through our bookstore. In this beautiful board book, Curious George has a new Muslim friend who is about to start his first fast. Join George as he learns all about the Muslim holiday.
