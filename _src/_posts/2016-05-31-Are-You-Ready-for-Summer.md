With Memorial Day having just passed us by, I wanted to send out a quick 
reminder to everyone that the Summer Reading Contest, Summer Storytime 
and a monthly summer family film series are just around the corner. That 
means making sure all your little ones have library cards and visit us a 
few times to participate.

The Summer Reading Contest will run June 6th through September 2nd. One 
grand prize winner will be announced Friday, September 16th, and will 
receive a movie night with popcorn and snacks for themselves and up to 
10 of their closest friends. No reading logs will be accepted after 
September 2nd.

Summer Storytime will run weekly starting Thursday, June 9th. This year, 
Storytime also includes some bilingual books, so if you are interested 
in exposing your child to the Arabic language, now is the time to start. 
We will be finding ways to continue these storytimes on a monthly basis 
throughout the year.


Also, this summer we are bringing back monthly film screening events to 
the center. Once a month on a Friday, patrons will be able to visit the 
center to watch family-friendly Islamic films. Once the titles are 
finalized we will post the list, so stay tuned for more thrilling 
announcements.
