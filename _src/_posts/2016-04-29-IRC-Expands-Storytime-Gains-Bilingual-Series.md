We have been tirelessly working to add books into our library and not only provide you with the first lending library of Islamic materials of its kind but also to expand our collection into Arabic materials. I may have mentioned this before, but with the inclusion of some of our newest arrivals (208 Arabic Scholastic books working their way into our collection), we officially have enough materials to not just have a Children's Arabic collection, but have its own space. Many of these books are well-known English books that have been translated into Arabic. Titles include "Heidi," "Princesses Don't Wear Jeans," and "Is Your Mama a Llama."

In addition, we heard your requests for more children's programming during the school year, in particular your requests for children's story time. So, "back by popular demand," we are starting this expansion by adding monthly story time sessions year-round to our already quickly expanding lineup of events for the community. Starting this summer, these will be bilingual events with all stories being told in both Arabic and English in addition to our regularly scheduled story times.

We can't wait for you to discover our collection!
