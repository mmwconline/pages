        The Milwaukee Muslim Women's Coalition works hard to provide the communities we touch with accurate information
        and resources to further the understanding of Islam and of the Muslim community. Below are a list of resources
        for information, studies, and help.

    <h2>Aziza Magazine</h2>

    <p>
        The Azizah team is grateful and pleased to be sharing the powerful stories and rich images of Muslim women in
        North America with the world. In doing so, we counter the many negative portrayals, the one-dimensional
        stereotypes and misconceptions about Muslim women commonly held, both within the Muslim community and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://karamah.org/" target="_blank">KARAMAH</a>, Muslim Women Lawyers for Human Rights, is a
        U.S.-based non profit organization that derives its name from the Arabic term “karamah”, which means dignity.
        KARAMAH’s vision and mission are informed by the view that a just society values the informed participation of
        its members through the pursuit of knowledge, access to opportunities, and equity among all “children of Adam”,
        regardless of gender or other differences.
    </p>
    <p>
        KARAMAH seeks to create a global network of advocates for the rights of Muslim women, who are knowledgeable
        about the gender-equitable principles of Islam, possess the capacity to share this information with others,
        and are able to advance the cause of Muslim women’s rights in legal and social environments.  KARAMAH works
        to build this global network of informed, empowered advocates in two ways – first, by creating and sharing
        knowledge about the rights Islamic law grants to women, and second, by educating Muslim women in Islamic
        jurisprudence, leadership, and conflict resolution, so that they may become the leading agents of change within
        their communities.
