Ambassador Akbar Ahmed, a world-renowned anthropologist, Islamic 
scholar, and filmmaker, explores Islam in Europe and the place of Islam
in European history and civilization in this unprecedented study. In
the film shot across the continent in countries such as Germany,the
U.K., France, Spain, and Bosnia, we hear from some of Europe’s most
prominent figures, including presidents and prime ministers, 
archbishops, chief rabbis, grand muftis, heads of right-wing 
parties, and every-day Europeans from a variety of backgrounds.

The film has received praise from some of Europe’s most prominent 
leaders. Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, states, 
“It is hard to exaggerate the importance of this work.” Dr. Haris 
Silajdzic, the former President and Prime Minister of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, writes, “Ambassador Akbar Ahmed’s latest project on Muslims 
in Europe is yet another illustration of his vision by offering us 
understanding of, commitment to, and hope and compassion for humanity.” 
And Paul Smith, the USA Director of the British Council here in 
Washington, writes, “Your film is a compelling, gracious, thoughtful 
study and we’re proud to be involved in it.”

We'll see you there.
