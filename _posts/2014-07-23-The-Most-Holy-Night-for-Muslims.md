For Muslims around the world, Laylat Al Qadr is considered the holiest night of the year, it is a night of immense forgiveness and blessings from Allah (God).  It is traditionally celebrated on the 27th night of Ramadan. It is often referred to as the "Night of Power," and commemorates the night that the Muslim scripture, the Quran first began to be revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.  The first words of the revelation are, "Read! In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists) 96:1.  Within this one sentence, Muslims recognize the injunction of seeking knowledge and the firm belief that Allah (God) is the Creator of all that exists.  This verse also brings together the importance of belief that comes through knowledge.  

Muslims around the world observe this night in prayer, recitation of the Quran, earnest repentance, thanks, praise and supplication to Allah.  Thanking Allah for His immense blessings and bounties, and asking Allah for patience and perseverance in order to handle any trials and tribulations that one may be facing, or may encounter in the future.  The Quran is considered by Muslims to be the greatest gift to humanity; what can be greater than a gift that brings peace to one's soul.  Knowing that nothing happens without God's knowledge and that everyone will one day come to account for their life and how they lived it, their wealth and how they spent it, and their actions and how it affected others. 

This night is so important an entire chapter of the Quran is dedicated to it.  It is a night of forgiveness, blessings and transformation, even minimally devout Muslims observe this powerful night because one does not know if they will be among those that live to observe it the following year.  As we spend the entire night becoming closer to Allah, seeking His immense mercy, compassion and blessings, let us also remember and pray for all of those in the world that suffer from fear, poverty, injustice and oppression.  May Allah alleviate their suffering and pain.  Let us always remember Allah's presence in our life, His knowledge of all things whether apparent or hidden, and the firm belief in His ultimate justice.
