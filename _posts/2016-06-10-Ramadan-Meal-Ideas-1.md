Okay, we started the tradition last year with the occasional IRC 
Facebook post during Ramadan in which I shared a couple of the delicious 
recipes found in the cookbooks in our bookstore. After all, we all know 
how stressful cooking can be around the holidays. So during the month of 
Ramadan we will be sharing a few easy recipes you can try at home from 
some of our fantastic cookbooks along with tips, tricks, and our own 
experiences with some of the dishes. Check back weekly to find new posts 
with recipes, crafts, and more. Ramadan Mubarak everyone!

We will start the series off with this wonderful recipe for grilled lamb 
chops adapted from the book *5 spices, 50 dishes*

## Lamb Chops with a Spicy Rub
*Serves 4*

#### Ingredients
* 1 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger (roughly 2-inch piece)
* 1 teaspoon finely grated garlic (roughly 2 large cloves)
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon cayenne
* ½ teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon ground coriander
* ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
* 8 lamb rib chops (about 1 pound 4 ounces)
* 3 tablespoons canola oil

In a bowl large enough to hold the chops, mix together all of the spices 
to form a thick, slightly dry paste. Rub the chops well with this mixture 
and set aside to marinate for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours in the 
refrigerator.

Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Sear 
the chops to the desired level of doneness, 4 to 5 minutes on each side 
for rare. You may also grill these chops  on an outdoor grill over high 
heat. Let rest briefly before serving.

#### Side suggestions
Lamb chops tend to pair well with potatoes, rice (pilafs are nice), or 
green vegetables. I have even seen a wonderful couscous salad with 
cucumbers, red onions and various herbs that worked wonders as a side 
dish to this flavorful lamb.

Stay tuned for more recipes as the month continues. This cookbook and 
others like it are available from our bookstore at the IRC. We return 
you now to your regularly scheduled library blog.
