First up is the Soft Cheese Salad with Tomato and Basil Topped with 
Asparagus from the *World Vegetarian* cookbook by Madhur Jaffrey. 
We will follow this up with a potato s from *The Iraqi Cookbook* by 
Lamees Ibrahim.

## Soft Cheese Salad with Tomato and Basil Topped with Asparagus
*Serves 4*
*Prep time: 30 minutes*

#### Ingredients
* 1 scallion
* 18 fresh asparagus spears
* 9 oz fresh paneer or mozzarella (the fresher the better)
* 1 tomato, peeled, seeded, and diced about 1/3-inch big
* 1/3 large green bell pepper, diced about 1/3-inch big
* 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
* 1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon peanut or canola oil
* 2 teaspoons oriental sesame oil
* 1/2 cup fresh basil, cut into fine strips (chiffonade)

Cut the scallion into 2" segments, stack, and slice into very fine 
rounds. Put them into a small bowl of ice water, cover and refrigerate 
for 30 minutes. Drain, spread in a dish towel and wring out.

Cut off (or snap off) the tough ends of the asparagus spears and 
discard. Peel the lower half of the spears, then cut into 1/3-inch 
segments, leaving the heads whole.

In a bowl, crumple the cheese into small pieces. Add the scallion, 
tomato, bell pepper, parsley, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and 3/4 
teaspoon salt. Mix well and set aside.

Put the vegetable oil in a nonstick medium frying pan or saute pan and 
set over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add the asparagus and stir 
once or twice. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup water to 
the pan and mix. Cover and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the asparagus 
is just tender. Uncover and add the sesame oil; stir to mix. turn the 
heat up to high and cook until all the liquid evaporates. Remove from 
the heat.

Toss the basil with the cheese mixture. Mix well. The asparagus can 
either be arranged on top of the cheese mixture or mixed into the 
cheese. Serve warm, at room temperature or chilled.

Note: This recipe looks like it has a lot going on, but really it comes 
down to preparing the scallion, cooking the asparagus, and mixing 
everything together. It is quite simple to make and is a nice cheery 
dish to go alongside your main creation or to be served as the main 
course.

## Potato Salad (Zalatat Potaita)
*Serves 2-3 people*

#### Ingredients
* 4-5 medium or 8-10 small new potatoes
* 2-3 medium tomatoes
* 1 large cucumber
* 1 green pepper
* 1 red pepper
* 1 handful fresh parsley, chopped
* lemon juice
* olive oil
* salt and black pepper to taste

Boil the potatoes until soft and allow them to cool. Peel and cut the 
cooled potatoes into cubes and set aside.

Chop the tomatoes, peppers and cucumber into cubes.

Mix all cut ingredients together. Season with salt and black pepper. Add 
in the chopped parsley, lemon juice and olive oil.
